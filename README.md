<h1 align="center">iMarketplace Project</h1>

<p>This project leverages modern web development tools and libraries to create a dynamic and engaging online marketplace. Below is an overview of the technologies used:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>React</strong>: Our project is built on React, a powerful library for creating interactive web interfaces. With React, we construct components that are easy to use and reuse, making our code more organized and efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>: For managing the application state, we've chosen Redux Toolkit. It's the official toolset for Redux, providing convenient utilities like <code>createSlice()</code> for declaring reducers and <code>configureStore()</code> for setting up the store.</li>
  <li><strong>TypeScript</strong>: To ensure code safety and clarity, we're using TypeScript. It allows us to catch errors during development and facilitates project maintenance with its static typing features.</li>
  <li><strong>Styled-Components</strong>: For styling our components, we've opted for Styled-Components. This enables us to embed CSS directly into JavaScript, making our code more modular and easier to manage.</li>
  <li><strong>MUI (Material-UI)</strong>: Our project gets stylish and modern interfaces thanks to Material-UI, a React component library that implements design principles based on Google's Material Design.</li>
  <li><strong>Swiper.js</strong>: To create dynamic sliders and carousels, we're using Swiper.js. It offers us a wide range of options for customization and displaying content in slide format.</li>
  <li><strong>SCSS Modules</strong>: We apply SCSS modules for styling our components. This allows us to keep styles scoped locally for each component, avoiding conflicts and maintaining clean and organized code.</li>
