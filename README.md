# iMarketplace Project with React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, Vite, Styled-Components, MUI , Grommet Icons, Swiper.js, React-Loader-Spinner, React Router,  scss.modules. 

1. React: Our project is built on React, a powerful library for creating interactive web interfaces. With React, we construct components that are easy to use and reuse, making our code more organized and efficient.

2. Redux Toolkit: For managing the application state, we've chosen Redux Toolkit. It's the official tools for Redux, providing convenient utilities like createSlice() for declaring reducers and configureStore() for setting up the store.

3. TypeScript: To ensure code safety and clarity, we're using TypeScript. It allows us to catch errors during development and facilitates project maintenance with its static typing features.

4. Styled-Components: For styling our components, we've opted for Styled-Components. This enables us to embed CSS directly into JavaScript, making our code more modular and easier to manage.

5. MUI (Material-UI): Our project gets stylish and modern interfaces thanks to Material-UI, a React component library that implements design principles based on Google's Material Design.

6. Swiper.js: To create dynamic sliders and carousels, we're using Swiper.js. It offers us a wide range of options for customization and displaying content in slide format.

7. scss.modules: We apply SCSS modules for styling our components. This allows us to keep styles scoped locally for each component, avoiding conflicts and maintaining clean and organized code.
